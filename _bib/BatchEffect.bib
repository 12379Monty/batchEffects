	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The highly heterogeneous clinical presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the unpredictable occurrence of disease flares and organ damage. Attempts to stratify lupus patients have been limited to classification based on clinical information, leading to unsuccessful clinical trials and controversial research results. This study was undertaken to develop and validate a robust method to stratify patients with lupus according to longitudinal disease activity and whole-genome gene expression data in order to establish subgroups of patients who share disease progression mechanisms. METHODS: We used a cluster-based approach to stratify SLE patients based on the correlation between disease activity scores and longitudinal gene expression information. Clustering robustness was evaluated by the bootstrap method, and the clusters were characterized in terms of clinical and functional features. RESULTS: We observed a clear partition into 3 different disease clusters in 2 independent sets of patients, one pediatric and one adult, which was not influenced by treatment, race, or other source of bias. Two of the clusters differentiated into a group showing a correlation between the percentage of neutrophils and disease activity progression and a group showing a correlation between the percentage of lymphocytes and disease activity progression. The third cluster, in which the percentage of neutrophils correlated to a lesser degree with disease activity, was functionally more heterogeneous. Patients in the neutrophil-driven clusters had an increased risk of developing proliferative nephritis. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that SLE patients can be stratified into 3 subgroups of patients who show different mechanisms of disease progression and are clinically differentiated. Our results have important implications for treatment options, the design of clinical trials, our understanding of the etiology of the disease, and the prediction of severe glomerulonephritis.},

@article{Petri:2019aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We assessed the stability of BAFF, interferon, plasma cell and LDG neutrophil gene expression signatures over time, and whether changes in expression coincided with changes in SLE disease activity. METHODS: Two hundred forty-three patients with SLE were evaluated for disease activity, serological parameters and peripheral blood gene signatures in clinic visits (2 or more per patient) that occurred between 2009 and 2012. Levels of the BAFF gene transcript, plasma cell signature, Interferon (IFN) signature and the low density granulocytes (LDG)-associated neutrophil gene signature were assessed in PAX-gene-preserved peripheral blood by global microarray. The stability of repeated measures of gene expression was quantified using intra-class correlation coefficients. SLE disease activity was measured using the Physicians Global Assessment and the SELENA-SLEDAI index and its components. Using a mixed effects regression model we assessed: 1) the association between a patient's average gene signature expression over time and disease activity, and 2) the association between a patient's changes in gene expression over time and changes in disease activity. RESULTS: Gene expression signatures showed more within-person stability than systolic blood pressure. The IFN signature exhibited the most stability. Patients with high levels of BAFF and IFN transcripts tended to have significantly higher levels of musculoskeletal disease, skin disease, anti-dsDNA, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lower levels of complement. However, changes in BAFF or IFN gene signatures were not associated with changes in disease activity. Similar associations were seen between the LDG gene signature and disease activity. However, when LDG increased, complement tended to increase. Patients with high levels of plasma cell gene signature tended to have higher levels of anti-dsDNA and lower levels of complement. However, unlike the other gene signatures, changes in plasma cell gene signature significantly coincided with changes in anti-dsDNA and complement. CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression signatures were relatively stable within patients over time. BAFF and interferon gene expression were markers of patients with generally higher disease activity, but changes in these gene signatures did not coincide with changes in disease activity. Plasma Cell gene signature expression tracked with the traditional SLE serologic markers of anti-dsDNA and complement.},

	abstract = {The Nanostring nCounter gene expression assay uses molecular barcodes and single molecule imaging to detect and count hundreds of unique transcripts in a single reaction. These counts need to be normalized to adjust for the amount of sample, variations in assay efficiency and other factors. Most users adopt the normalization approach described in the nSolver analysis software, which involves background correction based on the observed values of negative control probes, a within-sample normalization using the observed values of positive control probes and normalization across samples using reference (housekeeping) genes. Here we present a new normalization method, Removing Unwanted Variation-III (RUV-III), which makes vital use of technical replicates and suitable control genes. We also propose an approach using pseudo-replicates when technical replicates are not available. The effectiveness of RUV-III is illustrated on four different datasets. We also offer suggestions on the design and analysis of studies involving this technology.},

@article{Risso:2014aa,
	abstract = {Normalization of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data has proven essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels. Here, we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more complex unwanted technical effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, called remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple laboratories, technicians, and/or sequencing platforms.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Why we sleep is still one of the most perplexing mysteries in biology. Strong evidence indicates that sleep is necessary for normal brain function and that sleep need is a tightly regulated process. Surprisingly, molecular mechanisms that determine sleep need are incompletely described. Moreover, very little is known about transcriptional changes that specifically accompany the accumulation and discharge of sleep need. Several studies have characterized differential gene expression changes following sleep deprivation. Much less is known, however, about changes in gene expression during the compensatory response to sleep deprivation (i.e. recovery sleep). RESULTS: In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of sleep deprivation and subsequent recovery sleep on gene expression in the mouse cortex. We used a non-traditional analytical method for normalization of genome-wide gene expression data, Removal of Unwanted Variation (RUV). RUV improves detection of differential gene expression following sleep deprivation. We also show that RUV normalization is crucial to the discovery of differentially expressed genes associated with recovery sleep. Our analysis indicates that the majority of transcripts upregulated by sleep deprivation require 6 h of recovery sleep to return to baseline levels, while the majority of downregulated transcripts return to baseline levels within 1-3 h. We also find that transcripts that change rapidly during recovery (i.e. within 3 h) do so on average with a time constant that is similar to the time constant for the discharge of sleep need. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that proper data normalization is essential to identify changes in gene expression that are specifically linked to sleep deprivation and recovery sleep. Our results provide the first evidence that recovery sleep is comprised of two waves of transcriptional regulation that occur at different times and affect functionally distinct classes of genes.},

	abstract = {Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.},

@article{Alhamdoosh:2017aa,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis allows researchers to efficiently extract biological insight from long lists of differentially expressed genes by interrogating them at a systems level. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of GSE analysis methods and hence it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to select an optimal GSE tool based on their particular dataset. Moreover, the majority of GSE analysis methods do not allow researchers to simultaneously compare gene set level results between multiple experimental conditions. RESULTS: The ensemble of genes set enrichment analyses (EGSEA) is a method developed for RNA-sequencing data that combines results from twelve algorithms and calculates collective gene set scores to improve the biological relevance of the highest ranked gene sets. EGSEA's gene set database contains around 25 000 gene sets from sixteen collections. It has multiple visualization capabilities that allow researchers to view gene sets at various levels of granularity. EGSEA has been tested on simulated data and on a number of human and mouse datasets and, based on biologists' feedback, consistently outperforms the individual tools that have been combined. Our evaluation demonstrates the superiority of the ensemble approach for GSE analysis, and its utility to effectively and efficiently extrapolate biological functions and potential involvement in disease processes from lists of differentially regulated genes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: EGSEA is available as an R package at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/EGSEA/ . The gene sets collections are available in the R package EGSEAdata from http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/EGSEAdata/ . CONTACTS: monther.alhamdoosh{\char64}csl.com.au mritchie{\char64}wehi.edu.au. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
