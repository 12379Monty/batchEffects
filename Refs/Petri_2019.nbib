AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the stability of BAFF, interferon, plasma cell and LDG 
      neutrophil gene expression signatures over time, and whether changes in expression 
      coincided with changes in SLE disease activity. METHODS: Two hundred forty-three 
      patients with SLE were evaluated for disease activity, serological parameters and 
      peripheral blood gene signatures in clinic visits (2 or more per patient) that 
      occurred between 2009 and 2012. Levels of the BAFF gene transcript, plasma cell 
      signature, Interferon (IFN) signature and the low density granulocytes 
      (LDG)-associated neutrophil gene signature were assessed in PAX-gene-preserved 
      peripheral blood by global microarray. The stability of repeated measures of gene 
      expression was quantified using intra-class correlation coefficients. SLE disease 
      activity was measured using the Physicians Global Assessment and the SELENA-SLEDAI 
      index and its components. Using a mixed effects regression model we assessed: 1) the 
      association between a patient's average gene signature expression over time and 
      disease activity, and 2) the association between a patient's changes in gene 
      expression over time and changes in disease activity. RESULTS: Gene expression 
      signatures showed more within-person stability than systolic blood pressure. The IFN 
      signature exhibited the most stability. Patients with high levels of BAFF and IFN 
      transcripts tended to have significantly higher levels of musculoskeletal disease, 
      skin disease, anti-dsDNA, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lower levels of 
      complement. However, changes in BAFF or IFN gene signatures were not associated with 
      changes in disease activity. Similar associations were seen between the LDG gene 
      signature and disease activity. However, when LDG increased, complement tended to 
      increase. Patients with high levels of plasma cell gene signature tended to have 
      higher levels of anti-dsDNA and lower levels of complement. However, unlike the 
      other gene signatures, changes in plasma cell gene signature significantly coincided 
      with changes in anti-dsDNA and complement. CONCLUSIONS: The gene expression 
      signatures were relatively stable within patients over time. BAFF and interferon 
      gene expression were markers of patients with generally higher disease activity, but 
      changes in these gene signatures did not coincide with changes in disease activity. 
      Plasma Cell gene signature expression tracked with the traditional SLE serologic 
      markers of anti-dsDNA and complement.
